    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../img/pizza.jpg">
    <p><strong>Pizza</strong> is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Mushroom</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Black olives</li>
        <li>Pickle</li>
        <li>Pineapple</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (a little less than 1 cup) lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza.)</li>
        <li>To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake</li>
