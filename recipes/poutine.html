    <h1 class="recipeheading3">Poutine</h1>
    <p class="intro3">Poutine is a dish of french fries and cheese curds topped 
        with a brown gravy. It emerged in Quebec, in the late 1950s
        in the Centre-du-Québec region, though its exact origins 
        are uncertain and there are several competing claims regarding
        its invention. For many years it was perceived negatively and 
        mocked, and even used by some to stigmatize Quebec society. 
        Poutine later became celebrated as a symbol of Québécois culture 
        and the province of Quebec. It has long been associated with
        Quebec cuisine, and its rise in prominence has led to popularity 
        throughout the rest of Canada, in the northern United States, 
        and internationally.
